## The given problems of the linked list are

1. Evaluate postfix expressions using a Stack. You can use ',' as a delimiter between two tokens in an expression. You can use '$' as the end of input. Always show the intermediate steps including the content of the stack. Take some example postfix expressions. Here is one example:
6, 2, 3, +, -, 3, 8, 2, /, +, *, 2, ^, 3, +, $
(Use '^' for exponentiation)

2. Write a program for the Tower of Hanoi problem. Experiment with a varying number of discs. Show the intermediate moves in form of messages like the following:

Move disk ... from rod ... to rod ...
