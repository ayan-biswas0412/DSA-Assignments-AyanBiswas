## ASSIGNMENT 4 and 5

## The given problems of the queue are

Implement a Queue using 

1. a fixed memory representation and 
2. a dynamic memory representation. 

Additional Problem of Queue

1. Implement a circular queue. Demonstrate that problems appearing in a linear queue can be circumvented in a circular queue.
2. Implement a min-priority queue. Your program should contain all the necessary functions like extract_min() and others.

In both cases, you should implement the two primitive operations, namely, insert and delete with proper guards. You should experiment with a set of insert and delete operations. Show the contents of your queue after each operation.
