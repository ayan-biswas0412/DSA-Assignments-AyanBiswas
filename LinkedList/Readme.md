## ASSIGNMENT 1

## The given problems of the linked list are

1. Implement a singly connected linear linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. 

2. Implement a singly connected circular linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. 

3. Implement a doubly connected linear linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. 

4. Implement a doubly connected circular linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. (For Bonus).
